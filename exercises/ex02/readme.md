# Ex02 phoenix start

In this repo I have been created a simple server with [phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

To run:

```bash
    mix phx.server
```

open your browser in `http://localhost:4000/` and voila!

![home](/readmeAssets/first.png)

Other routes:

- `http://localhost:4000/test`
![hello](/readmeAssets/second.png)

- `http://localhost:4000/say/{any name}`
![say name](/readmeAssets/third.png)

- `http://localhost:4000/say/Dpbm`
![easter egg](/readmeAssets/easter-egg.png)
