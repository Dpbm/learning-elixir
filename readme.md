# Learning Elixir

This repo was made to store my exercises while I learning [Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org/), so if you liked let me a `Star`

- [Elixir docs](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)
- [joyofelixir](https://joyofelixir.com/)
- [elixircasts](https://elixircasts.io/)
